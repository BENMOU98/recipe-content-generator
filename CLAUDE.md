# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Recipe Content Generator Web Application that creates SEO-optimized content for Pinterest, blogs, and Facebook using AI models. The application includes user management, multi-tenant website support, WordPress integration, and Midjourney image generation capabilities.

## Development Commands

- **Start server**: `npm start` or `node server.js`
- **Development mode**: `npm run dev` (uses nodemon for auto-restart)
- **Run tests**: `npm test` (uses Jest)
- **Initialize database**: `npm run init-db` or `node init-db.js`

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Entry Point**: `server.js` - Express server with session management, authentication, and route handling
- **Main Logic**: `app.js` - Core content generation functions for Pinterest, blog, and Facebook content
- **Database**: SQLite database (`data/recipes.db`) with multi-tenant support via `website_id` filtering
- **Authentication**: Multi-tier system (admin, employee, user) with organization-based permissions

### Key Modules

- **Database Layer**: `db.js` - SQLite utilities with website filtering and foreign key constraints
- **User Management**: `models/` - User, organization, and website models
- **Content Generation**: Recipe templates, WordPress integration, and AI prompt management
- **Image Processing**: Midjourney integration in `midjourney/` directory with image cropping and upload
- **WordPress Integration**: `wordpress.js`, `wordpress-db.js` - WP-Recipe-Maker plugin integration

### Database Structure

The application uses a multi-tenant architecture where all data is filtered by `website_id`. Key tables include:
- Users and organizations with hierarchical permissions
- Recipes with full content (ingredients, instructions, metadata)
- Keywords with image URLs and processing status
- WordPress settings per website
- Activity logging and image queue management

### Views and Frontend

- **Template Engine**: EJS with Express layouts
- **Main Views**: Located in `views/` - includes dashboard, recipe management, user management, and WordPress settings
- **Static Assets**: `public/` contains CSS, JavaScript, and images
- **Key Frontend Features**: Image cropping, user management, website switching, recipe editing

### Migration System

Database migrations are located in `migrations/` and handle schema updates, data migrations, and feature additions. Run migrations using the migration runner scripts.

### Utility Scripts

The root directory contains numerous utility scripts for:
- Database management and debugging
- Data migrations and fixes
- Excel import/export functionality
- Image processing and cleanup
- WordPress integration testing

## Environment Configuration

The application uses `dotenv` for configuration. Key environment variables control:
- AI model settings and API keys
- Database connections
- WordPress integration settings
- Midjourney/Discord API configuration
- Default language and content settings

## Recent Fixes and Updates

### WordPress Publishing Permission Fix (2025-01-17)

**Problem**: Employees with website access permissions were unable to publish to WordPress due to missing website permission middleware on WordPress publishing routes.

**Solution**: Added website permission middleware (`websiteMiddleware.hasWebsiteAccess` and `websiteMiddleware.ensureWebsiteSelected`) to all WordPress publishing endpoints in `server.js`:

- `/api/wordpress/publish` (line 4560)
- `/api/wordpress/publish-with-recipe` (line 4664)
- `/api/wordpress/publish-formatted` (line 4957)
- `/api/wordpress/bulk-publish` (line 5073)
- `/api/wordpress/bulk-ready` (line 5380)
- `/api/wordpress/apply-seo` (line 5487)

**Behavior**: 
- Admins: Continue to have access to all websites in their organization
- Employees: Can only publish to websites they have explicit permission for (as defined in `website_permissions` table)
- Users must have a website selected to access WordPress publishing features

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Added website permission middleware to WordPress publishing routes

### WordPress Settings Multi-Tenant Fix (2025-01-17)

**Problem**: Employees couldn't access WordPress settings because the system looked for settings tied to their user ID instead of the website ID. When admin configured WordPress settings for a website, employees couldn't see those settings.

**Root Cause**: The `getSettings()` function in `wordpress-db.js` was filtering by both `user_id` AND `website_id`, but WordPress settings should be shared across all users of a website.

**Solution**: Modified WordPress settings retrieval to be website-centric:
- `getSettings()` now primarily filters by `website_id` only
- Falls back to global settings if no website-specific settings found
- Removed user ID parameter from all `getSettings()` calls in server.js

**Files Modified**:
- `wordpress-db.js` - Modified `getSettings()` function to use website-based lookup (line 230-281)
- `server.js` - Removed user ID parameter from all `wordpressDb.getSettings()` calls

### Progress Bar Workflow Steps UI Improvement (2025-01-17)

**Problem**: Progress bar workflow steps (Facebook Content, Midjourney, etc.) had poor visibility with white backgrounds and light text that were hard to read against the dark theme.

**Solution**: Completely redesigned workflow step styling to match the modern midnight theme:

**Design Improvements**:
- **Dark Theme Integration**: Used app's color palette (--dark-card, --primary-purple, --accent-teal, --danger-red)
- **Enhanced Visual States**:
  - Pending: Muted dark background with grayscale icons
  - Active: Purple gradient with glowing border and animated pulse effect
  - Completed: Teal gradient with success styling
  - Failed: Red gradient with error styling
- **Better Typography**: Improved font weights, spacing, and contrast
- **Visual Effects**: Added hover animations, shadows, and scale transformations
- **Accessibility**: High contrast text and status badges for all states

**Technical Changes**:
- Redesigned `.workflow-step` base styles with gradient backgrounds
- Added state-specific styling (`.pending`, `.active`, `.completed`, `.failed`)
- Implemented CSS keyframe animation for active states
- Enhanced hover interactions and visual feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `public/css/styles.css` - Redesigned workflow step styling (lines 863-1007)

### Progress Bar Enhancement (2025-01-17)

**Enhancement**: Updated the progress bar styling to match the redesigned workflow boxes with consistent dark theme integration.

**Visual Improvements**:
- **Dark Background**: Gradient background matching workflow boxes
- **Enhanced Bar**: Increased height (12px) with rounded corners and shadows
- **Shimmer Animation**: Moving light effect across active progress bars
- **Color-Coded States**: Purple (default), Teal (success), Amber (warning), Red (danger)
- **Interactive Effects**: Hover states and optional pulsing animation for active progress
- **Better Depth**: Inset shadows and borders for more realistic appearance

**Technical Changes**:
- Enhanced `.progress` container with gradient background and borders
- Added shimmer animation with CSS keyframes
- Improved color-specific progress bar variants
- Added hover effects and optional pulsing animation
- Consistent visual language with workflow step boxes

**Files Modified**:
- `public/css/styles.css` - Enhanced progress bar styling (lines 836-914)

### Dynamic Workflow Progress Bar (2025-01-17)

**Feature**: Created a smart progress bar that dynamically follows the workflow steps during content generation.

**How It Works**:
- **Step-Based Progress**: Progress bar advances based on which workflow step is currently active
- **Intelligent Calculation**: Automatically calculates progress percentage based on visible workflow steps
- **Visual States**: 
  - Purple (active step in progress)
  - Teal (step completed successfully)  
  - Red (step failed)
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different content options (only shows progress for enabled steps)

**Example Workflow Progress**:
- Recipe Generation starts → Progress bar: 0% (purple, animated)
- Recipe completes, Facebook Content starts → Progress bar: 17% (purple, animated)
- Facebook completes, Midjourney starts → Progress bar: 33% (purple, animated)
- All steps complete → Progress bar: 100% (teal, static)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Enhanced `updateWorkflowStep()` function to call `updateWorkflowProgressBar()`
- New `updateWorkflowProgressBar()` function calculates progress based on:
  - Current step position in visible workflow steps
  - Step status (active, completed, failed)
  - Dynamic step visibility based on content options
- Smooth progress transitions with visual feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `views/keywords.ejs` - Added dynamic progress bar logic (lines 1412-1467)

### Sequential Keyword Processing (2025-01-17)

**Problem**: Multiple keywords were being processed simultaneously, which could trigger Discord's spam detection and cause rate limiting or blocks.

**Solution**: Redesigned batch processing to handle keywords sequentially (one at a time) with proper completion waiting.

**Key Improvements**:
- **True Sequential Processing**: Each keyword must fully complete (success or failure) before the next one starts
- **Discord API Protection**: 3-second delay between keywords to avoid spam detection
- **Complete Status Monitoring**: Waits for each keyword to reach 'processed' or 'failed' status
- **Better Progress Tracking**: Shows current keyword being processed with accurate counts
- **Workflow Integration**: Each keyword goes through full workflow steps individually
- **Timeout Handling**: 20-minute timeout per keyword with graceful failure handling

**Technical Changes**:
- Rewrote `processKeywordsInSequence()` to use `await` for each keyword
- Added `processKeywordAndWaitForCompletion()` for individual keyword monitoring
- Implemented proper status polling with completion detection
- Added inter-keyword delays to prevent API rate limiting
- Enhanced progress feedback with keyword-specific information

**Benefits**:
- Prevents Discord spam detection and account blocking
- More reliable processing with proper error handling
- Better user feedback during long batch operations
- Reduced server load with controlled request timing

**Files Modified**:
- `views/keywords.ejs` - Redesigned sequential processing logic (lines 1673-1859)

### Sequential Processing Status Detection Fix (2025-01-17)

**Issue**: Sequential processing was incorrectly marking successful keywords as "failed" due to improper status detection logic.

**Problem**: The new sequential processing code was not using the same status handling logic as the original working code, causing successful `status: 'processed'` responses to be mishandled.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `processKeywordAndWaitForCompletion()` to use the same status detection logic as the original working code
- Restored calls to `updateWorkflowBasedOnStatus()` and `startSmartImageMonitoring()` 
- Ensured proper handling of `data.status === 'processed'` for success detection
- Maintained compatibility with existing keyword processing workflow

**Files Modified**:
- `views/keywords.ejs` - Fixed status detection in sequential processing (lines 1815-1836)

### True Sequential Processing Implementation (2025-01-17)

**Final Solution**: Implemented true sequential processing where each keyword must fully complete before the next one starts.

**How It Works**:
- **One at a Time**: Each keyword is processed completely (success or failure) before starting the next
- **Full Completion Wait**: Uses `await waitForKeywordCompletion()` to wait for `processed` or `failed` status
- **Discord Protection**: 3-second delays between keywords + no simultaneous processing
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows exactly which keyword is currently being processed
- **Status Monitoring**: 10-second status checks with 20-minute timeout per keyword

**Technical Implementation**:
- **New `waitForKeywordCompletion()`**: Waits for individual keyword completion
- **Sequential Loop**: `for` loop with `await` ensures one keyword completes before next starts
- **Proper Counter Updates**: Uses original `updateProgressCounters()` function
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of timeouts and failures

**Benefits**:
- **No Discord Spam**: Only one keyword processing at a time
- **Reliable Status**: Correct success/failed counters
- **Better UX**: Clear progress indication for current keyword
- **Robust Error Handling**: Timeouts and failures don't block remaining keywords

**Backup Files Created**:
- `views/keywords_backup_working.ejs` - Backup of working code before this change
- `CLAUDE_backup.md` - Backup of documentation

**Files Modified**:
- `views/keywords.ejs` - True sequential processing implementation (lines 1673-1838)
